# volca_sample_tool

Just some tooling to automatically prepare samples for Korg Volca Sample.  Completely untested.  
Really most of the scripting is in preparation of the samples, including the ability to shorten the sample without adjusting the pitches, and to always ensure
That the sample set is size appropriate for the limited memory space on the volca

The actual upload to the device requires the command like Korg volca tool
I no longer have the voca.
